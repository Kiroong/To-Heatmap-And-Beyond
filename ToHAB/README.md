## Abstract

Complex data comprehension is a hard task for visually impaired people due to the lack of viable supporting tools. We designed a web-based interactive navigation system to enable visually impaired people to explore data tables on common mobile touch devices. Users can grasp overview and query detailed information through zooming in and out of a table. We also elaborated to make interactions simple and consistent with the mainstream mobile screen readers to minimize the users' cognitive burden.
